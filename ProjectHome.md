An mpd client for appletv, which tries to be "stealth" and blend in with the look of apple's built-in music player.  Supports album artwork, playlists, etc.

This client started life as a fork of atvmpdcontrol, although much of the UI is replaced, and by the time I'm done almost all of the UI will have been replaced.
